    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples]
        True targets of binary classification

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Estimated probabilities or decision function

    pos_label : int or str, default=None
        The label of the positive class

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    fps : array, shape = [n_thresholds]
        A count of false positives, at index i being the number of negative
        samples assigned a score >= thresholds[i]. The total number of
        negative samples is equal to fps[-1] (thus true negatives are given by
        fps[-1] - fps).

    tps : array, shape = [n_thresholds <= len(np.unique(y_score))]
        An increasing count of true positives, at index i being the number
        of positive samples assigned a score >= thresholds[i]. The total
        number of positive samples is equal to tps[-1] (thus false negatives
        are given by tps[-1] - tps).

    thresholds : array, shape = [n_thresholds]
        Decreasing score values.
